## Description

Provides a real-time Word Count and character count in the status-bar for Sublime Text. See: http://www.sublimetext.com/

Count words and/or characters on document or in selections. By default, whitespace is not included in the character count.

The minimal word length is 1 and does not count digits.

An estimated reading time is now appended to the end of the word count.
